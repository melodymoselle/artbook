[![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url]

There are many places to see and read about on art on the internet. 
It can be overwhelming. Artbook provides a single source to follow 
your favorite artists and art. We use 4 APIs to pull in different 
types of info and media so you don't have to have 10 different tabs 
open. And you can find suggestions based on artists in your collection.

##In Development
* Scheduling API calls to automatically update artist data
* Browsing artists by name
* Page of recently added items from a user's followed artists
* Manually entering new artists and artworks
* Upcoming shows for a user's followed artists

## Release History
